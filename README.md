# My notes on algorithms, data structures and stuff 🙈

![Markdown Formatting](https://github.com/pniewiejski/algorithms-playground/workflows/Markdown%20Formatting/badge.svg)

This repo is intended to be a kind of lecture notebook on algorithms and data structures. By no
means does it aim to be comprehensive or to provide any deeper understanding of the topic. It was
supposed to be more like a collection of brief notes, containing summaries of things I have found
and read online. Nothing more... 💁‍♂️

Problems that are presented here as examples are either simple implementation examples or interview
questions, that one could find online.

## Basic ideas

- [The _"Big O"_ notation ⏳](./BigO.md)
- [Divide and conquer ⚔️](./DivideAndConquer.md)

## Algorithms

- [Binary search 🕵️‍♂️](./binary-search/)
- [Backtracking](./backtracking/)
- Detecting cycles with [Tortoise and hare 🐢🐇](graphs/tortoise-and-hare/) algorithm

## Sorting algorithms

- [Selection sort](./sorting/selection-sort/) - Very simple, Time: `O(n^2)`
- [Insertion sort](./sorting/insertion-sort/) - Time: `O(n^2)`
- [Quicksort](./sorting/quicksort/) - Time: `O(n * log n)`
- [Merge sort](./sorting/merge-sort/) - Time: `O(n * log n)`
- [Heapsort](./sorting/heap-sort/) - Time: `O(n * log n)`

## Data structures

- [Hash Table #️⃣](./data-structures/HashTable/)
- [List 🔗](./data-structures/List/)
- [Queue 🚶‍♂️ 🚶‍♂️ 🚶‍♂️ 🚶‍♂️](./data-structures/Queue/)
- [Stack 🥞](./data-structures/Stack/)
- [Tree 🌳](./data-structures/Tree/)
- [Trie 🔤](./data-structures/Trie/)
- [Heap](./data-structures/Heap/)

## Issues 🤕
