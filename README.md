# My notes on algorithms, data structures and stuff 🙈

This repo is supposed to be like my note book on algorithms and data structures. By no means is it
comprehensive or providing deeper understanding of a topic. It was supposed to more like a
collection of brief lecture notes, containing summary of things I have found and read online.

Problems that are presented here as examples are very often simple interview questions, that one
could find online.

## Basic ideas

- [The _"Big O"_ notation ⏳](./BigO.md)
- [Divide and conquer ⚔️](./DivideAndConquer.md)

## Algorithms

- [Binary search 🕵️‍♂️](./binary-search/README.md)
- [Backtracking](./backtracking/README.md)
- Detecting cycles with [Tortoise and hare 🐢🐇](./tortoise-and-hare/README.md) algorithm

## Sorting algorithms

- [Selection sort](./sorting/selection-sort/SelectionSort.md) - Very simple, Time: `O(n^2)`
- [Insertion sort](./sorting/insertion-sort/README.md) - Time: `O(n^2)`
- [Quicksort](./sorting/quicksort/README.md) - Time: `O(n * log n)`
- [Merge sort](./sorting/merge-sort/README.md) - Time: `O(n * log n)`
- [Heapsort](./sorting/heap-sort/README.md) - Time: `O(n * log n)`

## Data structures

- [Hash Table #️⃣](./data-structures/HashTable/README.md)
- [List 🔗](./data-structures/List/README.md)
- [Queue 🚶‍♂️ 🚶‍♂️ 🚶‍♂️ 🚶‍♂️](./data-structures/Queue/README.md)
- [Stack 🥞](./data-structures/Stack/README.md)
- [Tree 🌳](./data-structures/Tree/README.md)
- [Trie 🔤](./data-structures/Trie/README.md)
- [Heap](./data-structures/Heap/README.md)
