# Problem and solution inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGVCnjXmrNg

# TASK:
#    You are given a list of words, for instance
#    WORDS = ["atom", "anathomy", "antenna"]
#    Then you are given a pre-fix, for instance:
#    PREFIX = "an"
#    Your task is to return all possible words that PREFIX can autocomplete to.
#    In this case that would be - ["anathomy", "antenna"]

# BRUTE FORCE:
#    We could implement it with a brute force approach, where for
#    every input prefix we will want to look for all words in WORDS.
#    Time complexity would depend on the size of WORDS and the length of PREFIX
#    This means that the time complexity here is O(n * a) - where n is the size of WORDS
#    and a is the length of PREFIX. This comes down to O(2n) complexity. 

# We could make the time complexity smaller by using trie data structure. 
#
# For simplicity, in this implementation we will use hash map (Python's dict),
# instead of array for simplicity, that's a small cheat ðŸ¤«

# Also, notice that in trie's nodes the value is boolean. We want to just keep info if we reached,
# the end of word. For instance a trie with a word "cat" would look like:
#  #0: {"c": #1}, is_word = false
#  #1: {"a": #2}, is_word = false
#  #2: {"t": #3}, is_word = true
#  #3: NULL

# COMPLEXITY: 
#    By using trie data structure we can reduce the time complexity to O(n + a),
#    which could be simplified here to O(n) - time depends linearly on the number of elements in WORDS.
#    Space complexity is related to the size of the trie structure, so that's O(n).
