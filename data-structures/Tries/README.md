# Tries

Trie or a _prefix tree_ is a data structure that allows us to store a _set_ or an _associative
array_. With tries keys are usually strings.

> Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node;
> instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants
> of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated
> with the empty string.

The name _trie_ comes from the word _retrieval_.

We could think of tries as storing letters of the alphabet in nodes and in order to **retrieve**
words one has to traverse down the tree. In the nodes we can store different kind of data. Quite
often it will be just boolean values. (Like in a example in
[this python script](./autocompletion.py))

Keep in mind that the size of the trie will the depend on the size of the "alphabet".

This idea was explained in a very nice way in this
[Harvard CS50 YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRg9DQFu0kU).

## Applications

- Autocomplete / predictive text (eg. on smartphone keyboard). Here we take advantage of tries'
  quick search, insert and delete operations.

- We can use trie as a replacement for a _hash map_. There are a couple of advantages of tries over
  hash maps:

  ðŸ‘Œ Lookup is faster in the pessimistic case. A hash map with many collisions has a lookup time of
  `O(n)` (`n` being the number of entries), whereas trie has a lookup time of `O(m)`, where `m` is
  the length of the search string ðŸ‘Œ No collisions. ðŸ‘Œ No need for hash functions, which could be
  expensive to compute. However, there are also some disadvantages that we have to keep in mind. ðŸ‘Ž
  Sometimes trie can take up more space than a hash map would ðŸ‘Ž Floating point key can lead to long
  chains & prefixes that are kinda useless ðŸ‘Ž Lookup time can be slower compared to a hash map
  (especially if we're dealing with a slow random-access read, like when reading from a hard drive.)

## Pros and cons

When compared to _hash maps_, tries have a few advantages:

ðŸ‘Œ Lookup is faster in the pessimistic case. A hash map with many collisions has a lookup time of
`O(n)` (`n` being the number of entries), whereas trie has a lookup time of `O(m)`, where `m` is the
length of the search string

ðŸ‘Œ No collisions.

ðŸ‘Œ No need for hash functions, which could be expensive to compute.

However, there are also some disadvantages that we have to keep in mind.

ðŸ‘Ž Sometimes trie can take up more space than a hash map would

ðŸ‘Ž Floating point key can lead to long chains & prefixes that are kinda useless

ðŸ‘Ž Lookup time can be slower compared to a hash map (especially if we're dealing with a slow
random-access read, like when reading from a hard drive.)

# Complexity

**Time complexity of creation of a trie is** `O(m + n)`, where `n` is the total number of words and
`m` is the length of the longest word.

Time complexity of **search**, **insert** and **delete** operations is `O(k * n)`, where `n` is the
total number of words and `k` is the length of word.

Notice that time of these operations depend on the word's length. So a shorter word will be searched
for (or inserted , or removed) faster than a longer word.

# Implementation

A definitely oversimplified way of implementing tries in python.

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.children = {} # Here we simplify and assume that children is of type Dict[str, TrieNode]
        self.value = value

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode(None)

    def find(self, key):
        current = self.root
        for letter in key:
            if letter in current.children:
                current = current.children[letter]
            else:
                return None
        return current.value

    def insert(self, key, value):
        current = self.root
        for letter in key:
            if not letter in current.children:
                current.children[letter] = TrieNode(None)
            current = current.children[letter]
        current.value = value
```
