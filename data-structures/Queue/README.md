# Queues 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️

Queue is a linear structure where the insertion and removal operations follow the FIFO (First In,
First Out) rule. Queues allow for two operations:

- `enqueue` - `O(1)`
- `dequeue` - `O(1)`

# Applications

- The idea of a queue is used in job schedulers.
- Handling requests - sometimes if we are not able to handle all requests at once, they are queued.
- Handling of interrupts in real-time systems.
